## 2026-07-20 - [Caching In-Memory Filtering and Flattening Results on 1000+ Items Dataset]
**Learning:** The portfolio dataset contains over 1,000 items and is queried on every pagination, filtering, and page load event. Repeatedly calling `.filter()` on `this.portfolioData` inside `appendItems()` and `.flat()` on `this.mediaData` inside `getFilteredItems()` incurs significant CPU overhead, especially during scrolling and category transitions. Adding a simple, lazy-initialized in-memory cache (`this.filteredCache` and `this._flatMediaDataCache`) avoids this redundant O(N) overhead entirely after the first access.
**Action:** Always verify if large datasets are queried frequently in high-speed interaction paths (like scrolling or category tabs), and apply lazy-initialized memoization/caching to keep operations at O(1) complexity.
